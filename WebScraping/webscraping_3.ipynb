              " 'The theme of this paper is an examination of the ‘inbetween-ness’ of semi-rural marginal areas through the concept of capital resources, and of mechanisms for the improved integration of such areas into wider tourism processes. This is set within an attempt to conceptualize semi-rural marginal areas for tourism and recreation. The South Ayrshire coastal region of South-West Scotland is employed as a case study area. The paper re-emphasizes the importance of well co-ordinated strategic collaboration and cooperation to better integrate marginal and poorly defined areas where the potential of existing tourism capital may be unrealized.',\n",
              " \"The relationship between tourism, health and well-being is a complex one based on interactions between the motivations of the travellers and the opportunities provided by the destinations. Much of the discussion to date has been dominated by descriptions of emerging opportunities and services, a focus on the provision of services such as health spas and wellness retreats and definitions based on this supply rather than demand. This paper argues that the focus on the supply side can distort our understanding of the phenomenon and therefore focuses on the demand side of wellness tourism and explores tourist motivation in a series of surveys conducted with tourists to Australia's Great Barrier Reef region over a seven year period. An analysis of the changing patterns of travel motivation to this destination provides some evidence that tourist motives to this region have moved towards incorporating a greater focus on aspects of well-being. More detailed examination of the recent surveys revealed the existence of two motive clusters with links to wellness—one focussed on family well-being and the other one emphasizing the restorative elements of being in a natural environment. The results support the existence of two different expressions of an interest in well-being reflecting an inner-outer directedness dichotomy common in psychology. The paper concludes with implications for understanding wellness tourism and tourism motivation in general.\",\n",
              " 'Selling souvenirs has been frequently considered a way for communities to benefit economically from tourism, especially in rural or poor areas. Locally-made souvenirs have the benefit of having low leakage, but imported souvenirs are often sold alongside locally-made souvenirs. The sale of imported souvenirs contributes to leakage of revenues from the local area. This paper discusses economic impacts of souvenir sales in peripheral regions using a case study of a remote tourist destination in Northern Thailand. The case study indicates that imported souvenirs make up a majority of souvenirs sold and have much greater leakage than local souvenirs. The case study raises questions as to the effectiveness of importing souvenirs as an economic strategy. The study concludes by providing some local-level strategies to increase the economic impact of souvenirs.',\n",
              " \"Australia has attracted substantial Chinese enrolments into tourism and hospitality programmes. This qualitative study examines the experiences of Chinese postgraduate students undertaking a master's degree in tourism and hospitality within Australia. Chinese students enrolled in programmes at two major providers of tourism higher education participated in a series of focus groups and interviews. Respondents indicated that their unfamiliarity with the cultural and learning environment impacted on many aspects of their life generally and study particularly. It is clear that a significant gap exists between prevailing approaches within Australia towards tourism and hospitality education and the perceptions of Chinese students about their learning specifically and experience in general. Some of the discrepancies include the process of selection into a programme, the role of exams and assessment, styles of teaching and learning, engagement with industry, and approaches to knowledge. In addressing and subsequently overcoming these challenges, respondents felt that they had acquired considerable cross-cultural, academic, and practical benefits.\",\n",
              " 'It has been well established that there is a link between film and tourism; however, to date most studies from the field of tourism have been singular cases, which has built a body of knowledge, but is rarely integrated with a wider discussion of film and tourism. By studying the broader concept of the moving image, this paper takes the reader back to pre-cinema times in order to ultimately better understand the links between moving images, film and tourism. From stereoscopes to virtual computer games via phantom rides and travelogues, this study explores the various relationships the viewers have with travel and tourism.',\n",
              " \"Lack of trust in online transactions has been cited, by scholars in the past, as the main reason for the dislike of online shopping. The objective of this paper is to develop a framework for studying the influence of website characteristics on Trust in online travel portals and empirically validate it. In the first phase, a causal model is developed in which the relative importance attached to the different website characteristics, to generate trust in online travel portals, are identified. In the next phase, a set of models has been proposed, that focus on the customers' personal variables, i.e., demographic and psychographic—that moderate the relationship between these antecedents of trust, and trust. Our empirical model offers insights into the relative importance of the website characteristics contributing to trust in travel portals across customers of varying psychographic and demographic values in India.\",\n",

              " 'Local governments in China have begun to lease scenic areas to private enterprises to fund their development as tourist attractions. The terms of the leases are for 25 to 30 years, and sometimes more. The privatization of nature-based tourism resources presents both opportunities and risks for governments and the sites being leased. Based on data collected from three case studies, and using a dynamic system modelling methodology, we identify the relationship trajectories among the major stakeholders (i.e., local government, local communities and private enterprises) in nature-based tourism resources. Four system dynamic models are proposed to explain the mechanism of natural area privatization through lease agreements and their impacts on stakeholders and nature-based tourism resources. The analysis shows that there is an ideal relationship that can sustainably support all stakeholders and the natural resource base. However, corrupt relationships will have a major negative impact on all of the stakeholders, and can threaten the nature-based resource, leading to the failure of the privatization effort.',\n",
              " 'Some authors and researchers have argued that tour guides are well-placed to foster sustainable tourism outcomes by, for example, communicating about and connecting clients with the natural and cultural environment and its values (via nature and heritage interpretation), and conveying, monitoring and role-modelling appropriate visitor behaviour in these environments. However, research that has contributed to assessing or enhancing the sustainability outcomes of tour guiding has been limited. Moreover, tour guides have had limited exposure to the use of theory, tools and techniques for optimizing the visitor experience and visitor-environment interaction within a sustainability framework. Not surprisingly, then, findings to date suggest that guides may not be fully realizing their potential to communicate and role-model sustainability in their tour content and practice. With the ever increasing pressure for tourism to enhance its cultural and ecological sustainability, this paper presents a timely examination of the theories and research that have been and can be used to harness tour guides as agents of sustainability. After examining some of the challenges that constrain research in this area, avenues for future research are presented that are both theory-driven and responsive to the realities and expectations placed on tour guides.',\n",
              " 'Many urban tourists like to visit farms, but only some farm landholders offer tourism accommodation and activities. Their motivations have been explored previously in several countries, using stated-preference approaches. Here we report the first continental-scale revealed-preference analysis, which yields significant additional information and insights. Using multiple data sources, we inventoried, mapped and characterized all known Australian farm tourism enterprises, and examined patterns using both size-based and multi-criterion classifications. There are clusters of farm tourism enterprises close to cities and gateways, and isolated operations in more remote areas. We identified four groups: full-time, part-time, retirement and lifestyle operators. Characteristics of the farm property and business, the farming family, and the farm tourism business differ significantly between groups. The groups appear to reflect the joint dynamics of farm succession and rural amenity migration.',\n",
              " 'The research consistently shows that the constraints to accessible accommodation identified by people with disability are firmly grounded in information provision. Information is the foundation on which people make their travel planning decisions and the provision of detailed and accurate accessible accommodation information is critical to the decision-making process for people with disability. To improve upon this current situation, this paper seeks to make the connection between accessible tourism, consumer needs, supply-side perspectives, government regulation/coordination, sustainability, accessible accommodation information provision and strategic knowledge management. First, demand research is examined to understand the specific constraints identified by consumers with disability and the specific accommodation criteria they seek when planning their trips. Second, the paper presents a summary of the supply-side research that presents the industry perspective on the consumer group and their accessible accommodation stock. Third, as with any tourism market development government regulation and coordination have very important roles to play brokering an industry-wide approach to accessible tourism. While tourism has been predominantly a market-driven sector with government support for infrastructure and marketing, an avenue to improve accessible accommodation information provision can be fostered through their coordination role to offer a more sustainable approach for consumers and the supply sector while progressing human rights outcomes. The paper concludes by presenting a case study of an Accessible Accommodation Assessment Template as a foundation to information provision on which to base a strategic knowledge management framework.',\n",
              " 'Community-based Ecotourism (CBET) holds great promise in promoting environmental conservation, local livelihood, and cultural preservation. However, without a clear understanding of the differential benefits and costs of CBET for men and women, ‘gender unaware’ CBET research, policies and projects may in fact promote the welfare of men over women. That is, without a consideration of factors such as (a) the gender division of labour, (b) gender relations, and (c) differential access to and control over environmental, livelihood and cultural resources, CBET projects may unwittingly exacerbate existing gender inequalities in local communities. As a result, CBET projects may fail to meet their fundamental environmental, livelihood and cultural aims. Following a brief discussion of CBET, this paper provides a rationale for gender analysis in ecotourism, outlines the historical evolution of gender and development work, and introduces standard frameworks and tools of gender analysis. Using extant empirical case studies of CBET, the paper then discusses how both ‘efficiency’ (Women in Development) and ‘empowerment’ (Gender and Development) tools of gender analysis might be applied in the research and practice of Community-based Ecotourism.',\n",
              " \"Recent literature discusses movies and television as determinants of destinations' image formation influencing tourists' travel decisions. However, there still exists a lack of knowledge regarding the details of such screen-related influences on travel behaviour. This study attempts to shed light on these screen-related aspects and their role in influencing travel decisions and travel behaviour at the destination. In particular, it examines the role of the Austro-German Sissi movies in attracting visitors to Vienna (Austria). The movies were shot during the 1950s and Vienna served as a major set for the movie. Based on a review of the major literature in the field of movie-induced tourism and the empirical survey the authors are able to derive implications for destination marketing and further research recommendations. Questionnaires were distributed amongst visitors of Sissi-related heritage sites. The findings support the importance of movie-induced tourism by illustrating that the Sissi movies contributed to travellers' choice to visit Vienna and the film location.\",\n",

This article reviews how sustainability systems are being challenged by organizational habit and perceptions rather than analytical decision-making with respect to the relationship between health and safety, quality and sustainability. Environmental indicators are identified as the most conflictive; the key findings demonstrate that most challenges require a change in human behaviour rather than a technical solution. The data suggests that tour operators need to develop sustainability auditing tools that consider the impacts upon health, safety and quality within the accommodations. The Travelife sustainability auditing system provides a useful case study to demonstrate the necessary requirement for a complementary approach when conducting accommodations audits.',\n",
              " \"This study compares the Global Sustainable Tourism Council's Criteria (GSTC criteria) with the operations of voluntary statewide sustainable tourism certification programmes in the United States. The Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) established 37 criteria representing the minimum requirements that any tourism business should reach to protect and sustain the world's natural and cultural resources while ensuring tourism meets its potential as a tool for conservation and poverty alleviation. To determine the extent to which state sustainable tourism certification program participants associate with the GSTC criteria, we visited state certification websites to secure lists of certification program participants. Twenty-three statewide certification program were identified, of which 13 are represented in this study. Using the GSTC criteria, we found respondents' support (to some degree), the GSTC criteria surrounding planning, socio-cultural and environmental aspects of sustainable tourism operations. However, certain criteria were also identified as “not applicable” or in low agreement. These results raise questions of the universal applicability and understanding of some specific aspects of the criteria, including a need for additional education and training, increased access to resources to support operational changes and information. In addition, for some respondents, the relevance of socio-cultural elements to sustainability was not understood, or there was lack of understanding on how to achieve these criteria. The overwhelming congruency with GSTC criteria may be due to a number of factors including, but not limited to the knowledge base of tourism businesses within sustainable tourism operations, and the guidance and support of certification programmes addressing sustainability within the tourism industry.\",\n",

              " 'This paper traces the development of tourism certification in Botswana and examines prospects and challenges of successful implementation. A precertification study was conducted that led to the resulting Botswana Ecotourism Certification System (BECS), the main document guiding the implementation of tourism certification in the country. The BECS comprises of seven principles and over 240 performance standards; a Best Practices Manual provided detailed criteria to assist in developing the standards. The system uses a three-tiered structure designed to incorporate various tourism operations and levels of sustainability practices. The extensive groundwork done prior to implementation indicated that tourism certification in Botswana has the potential to facilitate sustainable tourism and ecotourism practices, especially in nature-based tourism areas like the Okavango and Chobe regions. The current implementation emphasis is on the accommodations sector, to be expanded in future—26 tourism companies in the precertification programme went on to register for certification since the BECS programme was launched in January 2010. However, early learnings indicate that limited policies and infrastructure inhibit the provision of necessary sustainability oriented services from other supporting sectors. For instance, municipal waste recycling centers and national policies that promote the use of energy saving devices in destination areas are lacking, but are important to certification outcomes. Despite these challenges, the BECS is comprehensive in vision and scope (it addresses both quality and sustainability), and has the hallmarks of a globally outstanding certification system.',\n",
              " \"This paper highlights the gap in current indicator-based approaches to address intangible cultural impacts and traditional owner values and ontologies in the development and management of tourism. Present approaches to management and assessment of tourism impacts on indigenous land and sea country (where “country” denotes Aboriginal space and place) are heavily influenced by “objective” science-driven approaches which rationalize and instrumentalize human-nature relationships into measurable units and quantifiable methods and indicators. They reflect a western Eurocentric cultural framework that erases indigenous peoples' worldviews, associations and relationships, viewing indigenous spaces as ecological landscapes rather than as culture-scapes in which “nature” and “culture” are inseparable and rules for access apply. Based on a case study from the Kimberley coastal region of Australia, this paper finds that the “wicked problem” of tourism access without traditional owner permission, a longstanding unresolved issue, continues to be the overarching cultural impact on traditional owners and precludes the finer scale assessment of site-based impacts. The manifestations of the impacts of unsanctioned access range from the scale of individual persons to regional climatic effects and are deeply embedded in the traditional owner ontology. It concludes that, first, there are essential prerequisites to the development of effective local-scale sustainability indicators of intangible cultural impacts of tourism. Second, the paper highlights an urgent need for working within (rather than on) indigenous ontologies in order to overcome the continuing embeddedness of colonizing practices in reductionist indicator-based approaches.\",\n",
              " \"Kenya's national parks and game reserves form the pillar of the country's tourism industry, and wildlife viewing and safari tourism are significant generators of income and foreign exchange. The promulgation of pioneer national parks in Kenya in the mid-20th century followed colonial practices of “exclusion” and “divide and rule” which marginalized local communities in decision-making processes and initiation of tourism programmes and wildlife conservation initiatives. Government supported policies and programmes that focused on wildlife protection and promotion of safari tourism also accentuated human-wildlife conflicts and contributed to species loss and habitat fragmentation. This study examines the evolution of Kenya's wildlife conservation policies and safari tourism programmes, and argues that safari tourism in Kenya has privileged Western models of tourism development and wildlife conservation, with historic exclusion of indigenous communities still ongoing today, though some improvements are evident. Postcolonial legacies influence the political economy of tourism in regard to the Maasai in Kenya; inequitable power relations are illustrated with the help of a literature review as well as a case example. The study offers suggestions to guide the development of future tourism certification programmes and indicators related to protected areas and safari tourism. Such programmes should be cognizant of Kenya's postcolonial context and attend to social and cultural sustainability, including issues of inclusion, exclusion and empowering local communities to participate directly in the management and ownership of environmental and tourism resources.\",\n",

However, projects which have an explicit focus on the alleviation of poverty through tourism (commonly referred to as Pro-poor Tourism (PPT)) are relatively recent. Given the brief history of PPT, research which explains the processes associated with PPT projects is required. This study considers PPT from a project management perspective and identifies the key factors involved in implementing PPT through an analysis of tourism development generally and the PPT literature in particular and tests their relevance and importance using mixed methods research. The factors have been categorized into three groups, based on an analysis of the relevant responses: external factors, higher order internal factors, and lower order internal factors. Several areas were identified as being important for the successful implementation and development of PPT: communication between stakeholders, a market approach, financial support, political, socio-economic and cultural environment and organizational structure. Considering these factors during the early stages of planning will assist with effective project implementation. Several areas were identified for further research: development of a model of successful PPT projects, connecting PPT projects to markets, and the monitoring and evaluation of PPT projects.',\n",

These relationships are influenced by the spatial proximity between individual firms at the local scale and agglomeration of tourism firms at the regional scale.

This study concentrates on the social and cultural factors affecting wildlife tourism management through a case study of Monkey Island in Hainan Province, China. Various stakeholders were interviewed about their views on conservation and tourism management. The “differential mode of association” of Chinese culture is used to understand conflicts and harmony in nature conservation and tourism development. It is shown that Chinese people are accustomed to treat wildlife in aesthetic and moral ways. A conservation model that does not take account of these cultural factors is likely to be ineffective. The research establishes and demonstrates the need and potential to study wildlife tourism from a cultural approach.',\n",
              " 'The purpose of this paper is to investigate the nexus between tourism development and the alleviation of poverty in the context of rural Bangladesh. Three quarters of the population of Bangladesh live in rural areas where poverty levels, as measured by income and calorie intake, are extreme. Forms of tourism that maximize benefits for the poor through providing opportunities for income and employment generation are explored. However, a number of barriers exist for poverty alleviation through tourism, including inadequate support from government, nongovernment and financial organizations, dominance of tourism by intermediaries and wealthy elites, lack of awareness and/or ability of traditional farming communities to participate in tourism opportunities and inadequate training and technical support. A single embedded case study involving government, tourism industry and non-government organizations (NGOs) in Bangladesh investigates these barriers. The potential for tourism-related micro-enterprises is then discussed as well as the need for industry, government and NGOs to work with micro-credit organizations to unlock opportunities for poverty alleviation through tourism in rural Bangladesh.',\n",

On the 1st of October 1991, the Balkans War began in Dubrovnik casting a negative image and abruptly halted the tourism industry. This study presents a longitudinal analysis of the interplay between media presentations and war. The purpose of this paper is to identify transitions in newspaper headlines and associated textual content representing contextual narratives of Dubrovnik's destination image. This work identifies periods of transition by locating changing representations of war and local preservation efforts in narratives and associated productions of Dubrovnik's tourism image over a 20 year period, 1991ndash;2010. Headlines and content during the period of war display the unmaking of Dubrovnik's tourism image. After the siege of Dubrovnik, locals were quick to respond; however tourism did not recover immediately because of the continuation of war in the immediate region. The Dayton Peace Accord ended the war in neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina and thus commenced the remaking of Dubrovnik's tourism image. Focuses on Dubrovnik by the mid-1990s began to show transitions, as newspaper content clearly divided then (the period of war) and now (post-war). In the final section, wars image has faded, but locals are concerned that overdevelopment, similar to war, will erode semblances of Dubrovnik's heritage.\",\n",

While human resource development (HRD) has been recognized as a critical component for sustainable development of tourism destinations, in the context of Small Island Developing States few studies analyse whether appropriate policies are in place to address HRD needs and opportunities for the tourism sector. Drawing on research undertaken in the Maldives, this paper explores the role of government policies in HRD as a contributor to sustainable tourism development. Using mixed methodology, data were gathered from tourism educators, local community representatives, and a survey questionnaire mail-out for tourism industry managers. The findings indicate that the government has neglected HRD policies in their overall tourism development plans. Further, this research suggests that the ad hoc government policies in HRD related to tourism have had a detrimental effect on the long-term sustainability of the destination and viability of the Maldivian tourism sector.',\n",

Several meta-analysis studies have appeared since the emergence of this construct in the 1970s, resulting in almost 300 articles related with this topic. The mainstream of DI research was clearly identified by Chon (1990) and updated by Gallarza et al. (2002). Despite the existence of such evidence after forty years of research, several authors still recognize the lack of theoretical framework, stressing the difficulty in the operationalization of this construct. The risk of it being theoretical and non-scientific is a reality. But, at the same time, a wider scope of DI studies has emerged, and new methodologies have come to light. Considering these conclusions after four decades of research, a shift from a static to a more dynamic analysis is required. Scientific progress is not linear and cumulative but dynamic and evolutionary. Therefore, this paper attempts to explore Hirsch and Levin's (1999) life-cycle model mainly applied to ‘umbrella constructs’ (UC)—encompassing their birth, growth, maturity and decline—as the perfect framework for an evolutionary analysis. Implications of the model for future direction of the DI construct are explored and elaborated, in order to provide some insights to open avenues along which DI research can scientifically progress.\",\n",
              " 'The aim of this paper is to explore how influential Lonely Planet (LP) guidebooks are to backpackers. Findings revealed LP to be of moderate influence, acting in a supplementary role to word of mouth information. The most important information source was word of mouth information amongst backpackers, followed by word of mouth information from locals, LP guidebooks and the Internet. Due to the difficulties of isolating LP guidebook use from these other information sources, systems thinking was applied in which these four most influential sources of information were conceptualized as subsystems which combined to comprise a larger backpacker information system. LP was then used as the starting point for a wider exploration of information usage amongst backpackers, incorporating the influence of the Internet and word of mouth information. Recent studies reveal that Internet usage amongst tourists has substantially increased during the past few years, demonstrating the speed with which the guidebook industry and backpacking is changing.',\n",

It outlines the process by which the fascinating ‘Otherness’ of the tiger in the wilderness has been gradually attenuated, as he was mastered by humans, first by virtual extermination, and then by increasingly strict forms of subjugation, eventually to become an apparently harmless plaything for patting tourists. The article dwells upon the tiger's resistance to domination, expressed in occasional outbursts of aggression, perceived by his masters as ‘accidents’.

              " \"This paper presents an analysis of visitors who engage with retreat tourism, a specialty subsector of wellness tourism. Retreats are usually centres or venues with a pre-prescribed aim of providing a combination of activities, practices and treatments aimed to balance body, mind and spirit in calming, supportive contexts. Wider research has been conducted in recent years on health and wellness tourism, which usefully gives an overview of product and tourist typologies. More in-depth research is presented here, beyond the spa and medical sectors, which have gained the most attention to date. The aim of this work follows on from the author's previous work on retreat operators, to give insight this time to the retreat visitor. Analyses of visitor profiles, characteristics, motivations and behaviours are presented. Methodologically, interviews, questionnaires, participant observation and secondary content analysis are all used to survey retreat participants in different countries. A combination of purpose-built, temporary venues and multi-location retreat companies were sampled to give a breadth of touristic experience. Visitor perspectives on preferred activities, operational issues, regulation and feedback about their experiences are presented within their own right and also within the context of wider wellness tourism, for comparative purposes. Research findings indicate important differences between retreat visitors and general tourists in terms of the often very personal experiences encountered, and therefore the concomitant responsibility of the sector to provide quality instructors and adequate care. The dearth of prior research on this specific special interest tourism niche allows for this work to fill an existing gap in the research literature.\",\n",

The methods used in the analysis included K-means clustering, factor analysis, Chi-Squared and independent t-tests, as well as ANOVA. The results indicate that both socio-demographic and behavioural aspects distinguish the high-spending festino from the low-spender. In particular gender, language, age, occupation, place of origin, group size and length of stay differ significantly between the clusters.

Not only is the ‘core business’ of religious sites more than just the creation of a ‘sense of place’ (Shackley 2001a, 2001b, 2002), but also involves an emphasis on both the maintenance and shifting of religious identities depending on the religious background of the visitor, making religious heritage sites a type of Third Space (Bhabha 1994; Soja 1996).',\n",

This paper employs utilitarian theory, in particular Peter Singer's views, in an attempt to more clearly understand the consequences of our use of animals in tourism. Emphasis is placed on broadly mapping the terrain of utilitarianism, identifying its central properties, examining some of the main criticisms of the theory, and exploring how utilitarian thinking can help in our consideration of the moral acceptability of certain tourism practices, especially zoos.\",\n",

              " \"Tourism has been recognized by major multilateral world agencies, the World Bank, IMF and United Nations, as a key economic sector for achieving a global transition from a brown to a green economic system. This transition includes an incumbent ethical mission, seeking to improve 'human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecological scarcities' (UNEP 2011: 1ndash;2). Nevertheless, five key challenges have been identified to tourism playing its part in fulfilling the aims of a green economy, four of which are directly related to its interaction with the natural environment and encompass a strong behavioural component. They are: a consumer trend to travel further for shortening durations of time; a preference for energy-intensive transportation based upon non-renewable fuel usage with an accompanying growth in GHG emissions; excessive water consumption; and damage to marine and terrestrial biodiversity. Simultaneously, the United Nations Environment Programme holds that the driving force of the greening of the tourism industry is consumer demand. The favoured approach from the World Bank and IMF to change environmentally destructive behaviour and reflect the full costs of an increasing ecological scarcity is through price and market correction. Other favoured approaches place a reliance on the greening of technology as a solution to environmental problems. This paper argues that these measures will not be sufficient to deal with the environmental challenges facing the tourism industry and system, and that without a stronger environmental ethic in the market it will be difficult to impose controls on tourists behaviour designed for environmental conservation. It subsequently analyzes the conceptualization of environmental ethics, the rationale for the evolution of an environmental ethic in society and evaluates its relevance to the tourism market.\",\n",

The submissions of 64 hotels to the Hotel Investment Conference Asia Pacific Sustainable (HICAP) Hotel Award scheme over 2009 and 2010 were analyzed. Three primary categories of sustainability practices were identified: operations-related, community engagement and design-related initiatives. A model of sustainable hotel practices is then proposed, which will assist hotel managers in benchmarking their organization to achieve higher levels of sustainability.',\n",
              " 'Urban fringe natural areas on public land are important resources for tourism and recreation use. However these contested areas are also in demand for a range of other land uses. How the land is managed can strongly influence opportunities for nature-based tourism and recreation, and the benefits that these bring to participants and host communities. This paper examines the case of tourism and recreation access to the forested urban fringe of Perth, Western Australia (WA) using a typology of land occupancy and management priorities originally devised for private land use. A review of legislation and policy relating to tourism and recreation access to land in WA was conducted. Tourism and recreation groups and land managers associated with access to the Perth urban fringe natural areas were interviewed regarding their perceptions of land access management. Most land in the WA study area is publically owned and is therefore technically accessible to the public. In regions dominated by multiple private land owners such as Europe and the UK, varying approaches to land-use management may be classified according to a predictable land occupancy typology that tends to be consistently applied. By contrast, the single public land holder in this area of WA, the state government, lacks consistency in its approach to recreational and tourist access to land. This creates both public and governmental uncertainty and confusion regarding where and how land may be accessed on the Perth urban fringe.',\n",
              " \"Cattle ranches are cultural icons in many countries. Still, high costs to maintain ranches may force some ranchers to sell their operation. One income alternative is to diversify into agritourism. Empirical research on ranch agritourism is scarce. This study provides an overview of, and assesses the motivations for, and challenges to diversifying into agritourism from the ranchers' perspective. A survey of 400 Oregon ranchers in 2003 found that 21% of 177 respondents promoted agritourism and that it contributed 8% to their annual household income compared to an 84% contribution from livestock production. Working on the ranch and hunting/fishing were the most popular agritourism activities. Main motivations to diversify were to utilize ranch resources, capture additional income, and offset fluctuations in income. Key barriers were insurance and liability, lack of time, regulations, and lack of financial assistance and resources. Agritourism was a success for 79% of those involved; 73% of guests were repeat customers and 38% learned about the operation from friends and family. Most guests (82%) were from Oregon. Findings suggest that agritourism can be compatible with ranching and can help ranches to remain viable. Despite low adoption numbers at the time of this study, agritourism initiatives are likely to increase.\",\n",

This paper explores the use of animals as food in tourism, drawing on the work of ecofeminist theorists for insights into the issue. It begins by identifying some core tenets of ecofeminist philosophy. It then demonstrates its relevance to the tourism context—specifically to the use of animals as food in tourism—by discussing several examples from the industry and drawing on existing theoretical applications of ecofeminism to animal food production and consumption. The overarching aim of this paper is to encourage the incorporation of this rich and textured theory into tourism discourse to help us reflect on what we currently consider to be acceptable behaviour.',\n",
              " \"The notion of the periphery and its relationship to tourism is one that has been a source of debate for many years. The concept of a periphery obviously raises the question of peripheral to what, while the term is often used in a relatively negative context with respect to levels of development and/or influence on central government decision-making. What the term does raise of course is the extent to which location still matters at a time when physical, virtual, capital and human mobility is supposedly greater than ever before. The four contributions therefore highlight a number of key points and debates surround the relative importance or, and relationship between, location and tourist movement.The lead piece by C. Michael Hall, from the Pacific periphery of the South Island of New Zealand, is charged with the topic of does tourism consume place and therefore lead to the loss of the periphery, and perhaps some of the very qualities that attracted tourists to it in the first place. The first response by David Harrison, also from the Pacific, looks at both the geographical and broader sodal scientific understandings of periphery. The second response from David Weaver utilizes the concept of experiential consumption to interrogate Hall's paper and also link to Harrison's reference to the importance of development theory in understanding notions of periphery. The final response from GeoffW all approaches the topic from an overtly geographical perspective and brings the research probe full circle.\",\n",

              " 'A significant current approach to creating compatibility between tourism and biodiversity conservation focuses on managing protected areas under collaborative management arrangements. The collaborating stakeholders are generally government agencies, non-governmental organizations, community groups and occasionally private sector organizations, with the balance determined by local circumstances. The aim is to create resilient governance systems informed by adaptive co-management philosophy. In 2005, a collaborative management initiative was set up at Komodo National Park, in eastern Indonesia, to manage a group of islands inhabited by the iconic Komodo lizard and several human communities. The area is popular with general interest tourists wishing to see the ‘dragons’ and with divers enjoying the rich coral reefs fringing the islands. The reefs are also the spawning grounds for fish-stocks exploited by fishermen based locally and further afield. The collaborative arrangements were designed to regulate both tourism use of the islands and fishing, but despite substantial investment of expertise and resources, it ran for just 5 years before collapsing. The reasons for its failure lie generally in the difficulty of managing complex social-ecological systems, and specifically in the overly narrow design of the initiative and in the political ecology of the Indonesian civil service, which despite anti-corruption efforts retains high levels of venality and weak environmental awareness.',\n",
              " \"Considerable efforts are underway to understand the behaviours of the growing number of outbound Chinese tourists. Existing research has shown that this market is complex, and an awareness of regional differences, change within China, and sensitivity to other world views are needed to guide studies in this area. For western researchers, several puzzles require conceptual clarification. These items of interest include what motivates Chinese tourists and are their motives different from those of western tourists? Among the other questions to be asked are, how do Chinese tourists interact with each other and their hosts, and how do they view unfamiliar natural environments? These are big questions and require a holistic and comprehensive approach to seeking initial answers. The paper approaches the puzzles posed by Chinese tourist behaviour by considering tourists' experiences as an orchestrated pattern of five blended forces. In particular, attention was directed towards the social behaviours, the role of sensory modalities, and the cognitive, affective and activity facets of experience. Further, this review explains how three major streams of influence (Confucianism, Communism and Capitalism) operate on and through the Chinese outbound tourists' experiences. The paper identifies these multiple influences as producing an oscillating triple-C gaze. The application of this concept can arguably help better delineate the perspectives of the twenty first century outbound Chinese travellers. As the quest to solve the puzzles of Chinese tourist behaviour gathers momentum, the opportunities for more longitudinal research and comparative studies viewed within this triple-C gaze are identified as useful complements to existing work.\",\n",
              " \"The most common stated reason for taking a holiday has been found to be ‘to reduce stress’. However, for families, particularly those with young children, holidays may create rather than reduce stress. Often the source of stress is derived from accommodation in destinations not having adequate facilities. Using online questionnaires that allowed in-depth open-ended responses, the findings from 71 respondents within Australia's State of Victoria in 2011 revealed that in many cases, accommodation facilities that purported to be suited to the family failed to deliver, and created stress. Often this was caused by not providing inexpensive basic provisions. Typical examples included insufficient cutlery and crockery, or poor laundry facilities. Such deficiencies either added to parents' workload or made basic tasks more difficult, which was not conducive to relaxing. In many cases, the family holiday resulted in an increase in unpleasant tasks and irritations, and was therefore not a relaxing and enjoyable experience. In fact, for 35.2% of respondents, their stress levels were either unchanged (19.7%) or had increased (15.5%) after going on their last family holiday. Family holidays then provided less of an escape from the everyday.\",\n",

The paper focuses primarily on deep green or ecocentric ethics, and more specifically, on how this perspective differs from other theories of environmental ethics—especially animal liberation—when it comes to the treatment of animals used for tourism. The debate on billfishing as ecotourism is resurrected for the purpose of explaining (i) why it is important to understand key differences between ecocentric and animal liberation ethics; and (ii) how both theories could have been used to better inform the billfishing debate that took place over a decade ago.

              " \"Inspired by insights from Topor's Le Locataire Chimérique (1964) and Roman Polanski's 1976 film version of The Tenant, this subjective account explores the hypothesis that because people own virtually nothing they are paradoxically attracted by a tourism which provides situations that are likewise bereft of belonging and identity within an alternative culture. The reflection covers three phases: pre-trip, travel and on-trip. The first contextual stage examines Topor's ideas of what it is to be a cultural tenant along with all that this status implies in terms of daily living. This is arguably akin to the experiences of his anti-hero, Trelkovsky, a Polish émigré, when renting a flat in Paris and coming under various prescriptions and proscriptions enjoined on him by the recently deceased previous tenant and the surrounding neighbours. Although he decides to escape such mental oppression, ironically he comes under a new set of obligations. These constraints carry over imaginatively from Topor's descriptions to the next stage of the current paper, in which Trelkovsky, now projected as a first-time tourist, continues his role as tenant by renting a seat on a plane, and, once arrived, by renting a taxi and a hotel room. Furthermore, at his destination, everywhere he goes he suffers increasing anomia. However, his greatest disappointment is an encounter with his supposedly more experienced compatriots, from whom he wanted to get away in the first place, and who find themselves in a similar predicament.\",\n",
              " \"Sustainable Tourism as a paradigm of development originated from the convergence of several streams of thought nearly three decades ago. It has tended to follow a ‘smaller is better’ theme but there are significant questions about the saliency of this theme in a 21st world characterized by change, contentiousness, conflict and uncertainty. Sustainable tourism is often linked with ecotourism and a dependency on natural environments as a principal resource providing the basis for an experiential product. The rise of systems thinking has led to new, and potentially more useful insights, about tourism as an economic development strategy in this context. Questions about the future ability of sustainable tourism to spur not only progress but the advancement of knowledge are presented and debated in this probe. The probe begins with a presentation by Steve McCool who presents a brief history of the development of the concept of sustainable tourism, provides an overview of how 21st century conditions are significantly different than those in which the term arose and suggests a reformulation of the concept to one of enhancing resiliency in the face of stresses and strains on communities. Responses by David Weaver, Richard Butler, Ralf Buckley and Brian Wheeller suggest that academia has a poor record of performance in addressing the real life issues confronting the globe's economic woes through sustainable tourism. Several feel that global economic and political power are so overwhelming as to make debates on sustainable tourism irrelevant. McCool responds to these criticisms by suggesting that knowledge is the principal barrier to progress.\",\n",

              " \"The focus of the paper is on tourism culture as it operates where commercial hospitality is on offer, especially at hotels and resorts in developing countries. It is suggested that three quite distinct perspectives can assist in helping us understand this aspect of tourism culture, which emerges where worker and tourist roles inevitably converge and interact. In themselves, such perspectives are not new, but they rarely seem to have been applied in the context of hotels and resorts. The first perspective, derived from the work of Homi Bhabha (1994), conceives of tourism culture as hybrid in nature, operating in a ‘third space’ between tourist and ‘host,’ and directs attention to the uncertain and negotiated aspects of tourism culture. In the second, that of the socio-technical system, tourism culture is seen as an interface between, on the one hand, the formal operational rules and procedures designed to deliver an organization's mission and, on the other hand, the on-going and lived-in cultures brought into the ‘system’ by tourists and the hospitality providers. The third perspective, that of the total institution, derived from Goffman (1968), focuses on the social and physical boundaries that separate the hotel or resort from the outside world and on the cultural practices that serve to further differentiate it and its population from the outside. It is suggested that use of these perspectives can further our understanding of the nature of tourism at different destinations and the ways hotels and similar institutions impact on both staff members and holidaymakers. As a consequence, they are theoretically and empirically relevant and politically important.\",\n",
              " 'Based on the animal ethics approaches of utilitarianism, animal rights and eco-feminism, this study reflects on the inclusion of animals in the tourism experience, more specifically, the use of promotional pictures of animals. The aim is to identify how the conceptualization of animals can be understood in relation to various animal ethics approaches and the local culture. An empirical case-study from northern Norway is investigated. The results show that the inclusion of animals in the tourism experience is based on different conceptualizations of animals. Some pictures show little or no concern for the animals, whereas other pictures indicate conceptualizations that are in line with one or more of the approaches to animal ethics. The results suggest that animal-based tourism may have limits in terms of offering a tourism experience that can be qualified as authentic in relation to the local culture. The results also suggest other limits of animal-based tourism, as regards education for critical thinking and ethical treatment of animals.',\n",

As the editor of this journal originally asked when inviting contributions and rejoinders, is tourism a ‘sinner’ or is it unjustly ‘sinned against’? In other words, since the late nineteenth century, modem tourism has attracted criticism in one form or another, initially in the form of social comment, subsequently in both academic and journalistic circles. Indeed, significant attention has been paid by tourism scholars and others to the negative consequences of tourism (and, of course, means of mitigating such consequences), to the extent that it might be assumed that tourism inevitably ‘sins’ against the places and peoples where it occurs. So, the question is posed—it is appropriate to view tourism as such, as the harbinger of social, cultural and environmental problems, or is this unjust criticism? That is, is tourism' sinned against' by those who focus, on occasion in apocalyptic terms, on the problems that are to a lesser or greater extent the inevitable outcome of the development of tourism, and is it timely to rebalance the debate, to consider whether an assessment of tourism deserves a more supportive or positive foundation?Given the complexity of tourism, the enormously variable forms it takes and contexts within which it occurs and, of course, the multiplicity of perspectives from which it can be considered, there are no simple answers or ways of answering the question. Thus, the lead piece is purposefully written to stimulate debate, to be deliberately provocative. And as the three rejoinders by Noel Scott, Jim Macbeth and Peter Smith demonstrate, it is a question that is worth pursuing.\",\n",

I discuss two contrary philosophical approaches to hunting in general, and then turn to the specific problem of the ethics of recreational hunting, arguing that its protagonists fail to render a consistent justification for killing animals merely for the experience, but create a hunting ideology which obfuscates the issue. While hunters claim that the chase is the main point of hunting, its conclusion in the kill constitutes the apex of the hunting experience. However, the intensity of the experience fades with the commoditization of the pray in the contemporary world. I present a series of settings according to the extent to which they are ‘framed,’ ranging from open areas, designated ‘wildernesses,’ and game parks, to game farms (and virtual hunting establishments), where tame and restricted animals are easily shot for a trophy at a stiff price. The outrage the hunting community raised by those practices, serves to highlight its moral supremacy. The article concludes that the paradox of killing a loved animal inherent in recreational hunting is irresolvable on the ethical sphere, but can be interpreted as an antinomian but exalted ritual, resembling sacrifice in the religious sphere.',\n",

Yet, the adoption of e-procurement in the hotel industry has been surprisingly low, despite its huge potential. Previous studies on factors affecting e-procurement adoption have mainly been in the manufacturing field, and may not be able to fully explain the low adoption in hotels. The main objective of this study is to develop an alternative theoretical model and explore the key factors that are associated with the low adoption of e-procurement specifically in the hotel industry in Hong Kong, a major tourism destination in Asia. Using a case-study approach, in-depth interviews were conducted with six senior procurement employees in different classes of hotels. Six major factors were identified: (1) technical factors, (2) perceived benefits, (3) conflicts between hotel owners and management, (4) resistance to change, (5) product diversity, and (6) rumours. A new model is proposed to show how these factors affect e-procurement adoption in hotels. The findings can help hotel managers understand how to develop a more effective adoption strategy for e-procurement.',\n",

Of the 52 national parks and reserves in Kenya, only 6 accounted for 70% of the total visitation in 2006. This leaves many conservation areas with hardly any tourism activity. While acknowledging that Kenya has not yet fully exploited its tourism potential, this paper puts into perspective efforts being undertaken by the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) in trying to popularize less frequented conservation areas since 2005. Indeed, a publication by the World Bank Group (2010) on the state of Kenya's tourism brought to the fore the fact that Kenya has an important ‘jewel’ that needs to be polished. Through an analysis of the brand names and images associated with different parks, this paper also explores the gaps inherent in achieving destination competitiveness at a micro level. Indeed, the branding exercise not only meant the rehabilitation of infrastructure but also a comprehensive community outreach programmes around the protected areas. Nevertheless, an analysis of the branding messages and intentions suggest that for the KWS, the brand names proposed limit themselves within the confines of the parks with no regard for the bigger picture of the surrounding environment within which the parks are found.\",\n",

These limitations are also a result of the fact that, in this age of specialization and super- specialization, broad as well as in-depth study of the parent disciplines is difficult and often not undertaken, but culminates in a limited understanding of the emerging discipline of tourism studies, which is expanding its frontiers rapidly and requires both specialization and generalization.',\n",

While there have been a number of demand driven studies of indigenous tourism, with few exceptions, little attention has been given to supply side capacity and in particular, the nature, scope and development of indigenous tourism businesses. Indeed, little is known about the factors that drive or inhibit the development of these businesses. Therefore in-depth interviews were undertaken with seven indigenous tourism business operators from Queensland, Australia with the goal to explore indigenous tourism operators' perceptions of what constitutes drivers and inhibitors of their business. The main drivers of indigenous tourism businesses were found to include training and knowledge, product development and funding. Identifying and understanding these factors will assist business operators to effectively prioritize them and in turn, will be better equip indigenous tourism businesses to develop and operate in an increasingly global and competitive industry.\",\n",

Findings showed that independent travellers, overall, had a higher preference for serendipity than following a structured itinerary. Respondents who were more ‘serendipitous’ participated in more activities, particularly sightseeing and outdoor sports, while those who preferred ‘structured’ travel took part in fewer activities, in spite of their planning. As predicted, the ‘structured’ respondents spent more time on travel planning and were more likely to look for specific information, such as price and location. The ‘serendipitous’ respondents, however, did not wander without knowledge. Searching for more general information about the area, they in fact used more information sources than those who preferred ‘structured’ travel.\",\n",

Owing to the complexities of the issues revealed by the case study, it is suggested that the dichotomous distinction between encroachment and legal ownership of land be abandoned in favour of a more nuanced terminology.\",\n",
              " 'Given the perishable nature of tourism products/services, an increasing number of tourism and hospitality companies, such as restaurants, hotels, travel agencies, and spas, are using multiple distribution channels to increase the market exposure of their brands and products. This study investigated the impact of promotion time frame (i.e., time lapsed and time to go) on the sales performance of tourism and hospitality group-buying deals. We also evaluated if the days of the week affect the sales of these deals. We analyzed 603 observations of 101 restaurant deals from the top 25 group-buying websites in Hong Kong and conducted an analysis of covariance to analyze the collected data. Results showed that the daily sales of restaurant deals are affected by the lapsed time, time to go, and day of the week. Given the combined effects of time lapsed and time to go, restaurants can achieve optimum sales of their group-buying deals by observing a five-day promotional period. The deals made available on Thursdays were found to achieve the highest sales. The results of this study will help restaurateurs and group-buying websites to determine the ideal promotional time frame for generating sales from group-buying deals.',\n",
              " 'To be able to say something sensible about the question whether or not tourism is a necessity or a form of luxury the determinants of the demand for ‘recreational’ travel and the characteristics of (the demand for) luxury are analyzed. In the demand for travel attention is given to the income and price elasticity and the impact of physiological, psychological and social variables acting as push factors for the emergence of generic demand. The distinction made by Harrod (1958) between democratic wealth and oligarchic wealth is amongst others applied to identify degrees of luxury. Further, the phenomenon of preference drift and reference drift as defined by Van Praag (cited in Pen 1984) is discussed in view of the net gains from increased income and consumption and the paper questions the rationality of the existing societal choice of work and leisure showing a strong preference for income over leisure time. It is shown that in the post World War II period a discussion on making another choice between work and leisure is a recurrent theme. The article analyzes how tourism may be affected by changes in the wider socioeconomic and political environment, such as ideas on social righteousness and income distribution, the environmental impact of travel and the possible future dictates of sustainability by investigating the degree to which tourism responds to basic needs and is considered a necessity, or conversely may be considered as a luxury that we can do without',\n",

              " \"The hegemonic view of tourism is as a global panacea for struggling peoples, environments and economies (Smith and Brent 2001). This article begins by arguing that increasing worldwide risks from human-induced climate change fundamentally alter the veracity of this prediction claim. As one of the world's largest industries, tourism is also one of the largest emitters of carbon, primarily from air transport. Far from standing apart from our carbon-dependent economy, tourism is quite profoundly a creation of that economy and cannot be an antidote to the very stuff of which it is made. Further, to the extent that tourism functions as escape from the ills of petroleum-driven life, it detracts critical attention and investment from home places and communities. The article concludes with a proposition for an alternative futures forecast based on bioregional tourism, or locavism. Characteristics of a locavist approach include the de-growth of the high-carbon, distant travel model of tourism and replacement with a low-carbon model that emphasizes local destinations, short distances, lower-carbon transport modes, and capital investment (both financial and social) in local communities.\",\n",
              " 'This conceptual paper uses a scenario planning process to facilitate possible futures for literary festivals, a form of festival tourism that has grown rapidly in the developed and developing countries of the world in the early decades of the 21st Century and which continues to grow towards 2050. The paper addresses this in the context of two significant cities, Shanghai—a megacity in China, and Melbourne, the capital city of Victoria, Australia. The paper offers two scenarios for literary festivals, one drawn from science fiction and the other from a process of prognosis. The aim of this work is to contribute to research in festival tourism studies by exploring the signposts and signals that may confer the future role, form and function of literature and the format and activity of literary festivals and literary festival tourism in a changing world. Utilizing signals and signposts, the work contributes to the body of work which seeks strategic responses to rapid change, rapid urbanization and possible zones of uncertainty that may await literary festivals and associated tourism and community activity in the future.',\n",
              " 'This paper situates current knowledge on family tourism with pointers to the future by drawing on multidisciplinary contributions to a recent consolidative book. Research in family tourism is limited, fragmented and individualized, thus not accounting for the diversity of family forms, sociality of family groups and multidimensionality of family experiences. Integration of thinking about and understanding the changing nature of families in tourism is needed. The key concepts of change are captured through a cognitive mapping perspective. This research process allows an exploration and systemic tool for constructivism interpretation. The cognitive model resulted in nine main themes that represent emerging and changing trends in family tourism. The key purpose here is the identification of the slow moving changes and trends that are occurring in family tourism based upon cognitive modelling of current research and their significance for predicting the future. This demonstrates connectivity between concepts providing a more holistic and critical interpretation of the future of families and tourism.',\n",
              " 'A panel of 22 individuals, each with an average of 51 years of professional experience in the tourism industries, was asked to draw on their extensive experience and make predictions about issues that may have an impact on tourism in 40 years. The panel participants, or tourism ‘sages’, ranged in age from 73 years to 86 years. A three-round online Delphi survey was used to collect data from the participants, which was used to make forecasts about the future of tourism. The foundations of future tourism success will be consumer-focused technology, excellent service, and proactive tourism policy designed to meet the demands of a more diverse travelling public. Tourism managers in the future will be able to capitalize on new demand brought about by social changes, such as increased personal wealth, increased lifespan, and less oppressive government regimes that allow more people to travel more freely. Contrary to other tourism futures research, this study found respondents to be less concerned about the natural environment and traveller safety, but more concerned about competing based on quality tourism product, experience, and service.',\n",
              " 'This article identifies major technological and social uncertainties relevant to the future of family travel. Future scenarios, constructed using the deductive 2x2 matrix, or GBN scenario process, depend on two factors that represent key social and technological change drivers: the demographic growth of unmarried, unattached, non-cohabiting individuals (“singletons”) and availability of technologically advanced virtual reality consumer experiences. As demographic shifts, wherein the individual is posed to outnumber the group as a consumer cohort, and technologies deliver virtual experiences that compete with a commonly shared reality, what is the future for family tourism and travel? The four scenarios offer possibilities that contain specific opportunities, threats and challenges to the family travel industry in 2050.',\n",
              " 'An affluent and ageing society allows consumers to refine their approach to health because they now have the choice of striving for perfect health, as opposed to merely living disease-free. The elderly are the most frequent users of health-related goods and services. At the same time, the growth in tourism has come from short breaks in urban centres, thus as consumers strive to extend their healthy years the spa holiday market is growing. In the United Kingdom a number of factors have driven the growth of the urban spa break including the rise of the experience economy, awareness of the health benefits of spas and accessibility to greater supply. This research paper identifies a number of key trends that are shaping the urban spa holiday market and future business implications thus allowing decision-makers an insight into the patterns of change that is occurring now.',\n",
              " \"Tourism in New Zealand represents nearly 1 in 10 jobs, 9.1% of the country's GDP and 18% of foreign exchange earnings. The country's tourism brand, 100% Pure New Zealand, is world leading. However visitor demand and global tourism trends are changing. The Tourism 2050 project, commissioned by the Ministry of Tourism and the Foundation for Research in Science and Technology, set out to envision the future of tourism in New Zealand by asking the question, ‘What will New Zealand tourism look in the year 2050?’. The research project produced four scenarios, Manaakitanga, An Eco Paradise, Perfect Storm and The State of China, which all follow different pathways and are constructed upon realistic circumstances. The purpose of the scenarios was to provide a foundation to encourage and promote discussion in order to understand New Zealand's tourism future and to ‘think differently’. The scenarios provided a comprehensive analysis of the external and internal challenges New Zealand's tourism industry would face in the future and conclude with a series of strategic recommendations which are the basis of a tourism national plan. This paper provides a detailed account of that scenario planning process, content and outcomes, thus providing policy makers with a blue print of how to do scenario planning in the tourism context and serves as a guide to the future of tourism in New Zealand.\",\n",
              " \"Today's visitor attractions are faced with a highly dynamic business environment which requires recurring and often high investments to remain attractive for customers and leads to a short life cycle. In order to help visitor attractions to anticipate future developments in good times and to make appropriate strategic decisions to extend the life cycle, the European Tourism Futures Institute (ETFI) has taken the initiative to carry out a futures study for the visitor attraction business in the Netherlands for the first time. The aim of the study was to acquire a reliable and plausible picture of the interests of visitors in the future and the development opportunities for visitor attractions in the Netherlands. By means of a survey with a representative sample of the Dutch population and a Delphi survey with the management of a few European amusement parks, developments in the business environment were identified that are expected to be the most important and most uncertain in the next ten years. The results were used to create four different scenarios that could be used by the visitor-attraction business to develop innovative strategies, concepts, products, services or business models that would make the attraction more future-proof.\",\n",
